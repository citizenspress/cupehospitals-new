      <description>Workers at St. Joseph’s Health Centre and Providence Healthcare are rallying to demand that their employer implement the collective agreement that was negotiated and ratified in May. The contract includes new provisions to protect workers from violence in the workplace and wage increases retroactive to September 2017.
Our Shared Purpose is the name of the Catholic hospital network created from the merger of St. Michael’s Hospital, St. Joseph’s Health Centre and Providence Health Network.</description>

      <description>TORONTO, ON – Over 100 part-time and casual clerical staff at Toronto Western Hospital have chosen to improve their working conditions and increase their job security by joining the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE).
Workers cited the need for a fair and equal staffing process, predictable and consistent scheduling, job security, and an end to working full-time hours on casual contracts that lack benefits and protection, as the primary motivations for unionizing.</description>

      <description>The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU) is the hospital division CUPE. OCHU/CUPE bargains a provincial collective agreement with the Ontario Hospital Association and lays that pattern down across the hospital sector and for those long-term care facilities that have a relationship with a hospital. CUPE bargaining sets the lead for all hospital service, RPN, and clerical workers in Ontario. Comparing our collective agreements to other unions bears this out.</description>

      <description>Hospital workers from Kingston and other southeastern Ontario communities will be demonstrating along with their counterparts at hospitals across the province Wednesday, April 18 at noon.
The rallies are the second in a series of escalating actions that 75,000 hospital workers, who are without a contract, are taking part in this April. It is rare for hospital workers to “visibly” protest in this way around their own contract negotiations.
CUPE, SEIU Healthcare and Unifor have formed an alliance and are mobilizing together to push Ontario hospitals to treat the hospital workers they represent with respect at the bargaining table.</description>

The unique and historic meeting of three healthcare unions brought together delegations from local unions and leaders from the three unions to discuss a joint strategy for bargaining. Local union leaders are meeting and voting on several motions to support a joint campaign to mobilize against the hospitals’ demands for concessions.</description>

      <description>What is Harmonization? Harmonization is the process of taking the Collective Agreements from all the union’s involved in the merger, along with any non union working conditions, and merging them into the new ‘first’ Collective Agreement.
Some employers see a merger as an opportunity to table concessions to Collective Agreements or non union working conditions but CUPE negotiates to maintain superior conditions and believes that you should not lose hard won rights and benefits due to a merger.</description>

      <description>What should I do if I hold a position at more than one location? Nothing! The employer has advised CUPE that they will not be making any changes at this time, even if you are working more than the Full time Equivalent or max hours in the collective agreement.
Human Resources as advised all their managers of this so no one should be advised by their manager or supervisor that they need to resign from any position.</description>

      <description>Joining CUPE A process is underway to determine the appropriate bargaining units and respective unions that will represent workers in the newly merged “Our Shared Purpose” hospital network.
Before a vote is called, the Labour Board, the employer and the unions must first determine the following: number and structure of bargaining units in the merged hospital; what positions will be included; and which unions will be on each ballot. The next mediation date is scheduled for June 2018.</description>

      <description>Dear CUPE supporter, We’ve heard from many of you about the misinformation and confusion spread by HR in a series of “info sessions” held last week. We would like to restore some facts into the discussion:
 CUPE absolutely can and will protect against layoffs. Our hospital collective agreements have the strongest job security provisions in the industry. CUPE members are entitled to: 5 months notice in advance of layoffs, retraining for other positions within the hospital, bumping rights, recall rights from a layoff to an available opening and layoff benefits and separation allowances.</description>

      <description>CUPE/OCHU&amp;rsquo;s anti-violence campaign Epidemic of Violence received extensive media coverage. The media reported on the polling and stories of physical attacks, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and violence in Ontario hospitals.
Every day, frontline caregivers are suffering serious injuries that lead to time off work and even post-traumatic stress disorder. Instead of protecting their staff, hospital managers discourage them from reporting incidents and have even fired a nurse for revealing the real epidemic of violence in healthcare.</description>

Hello CUPE supporters!
As you may be aware, there has been a merger between Providence, St. Joseph’s and St. Michael’s hospitals as of August 1, 2017.
With any public sector merger such as this, there are government regulations that guide the process. When merging workplaces with many unions, there must be a vote by the workers to select a single union to represent the newly merged workplace.</description>

CUPE bargaining sets the lead for all hospital service, RPN, and clerical workers in Ontario. Comparing our collective agreements to other unions bears this out. CUPE has superior language on seniority rights, job security, layoffs and recall, and health and safety to name but a few issues.
Did you know that?  With nearly 80,000 members employed in hospitals, long-term care, community care and paramedicine, CUPE is Ontario’s largest health care union.</description>

 Media Release
October 17, 2017
TORONTO, ON - A small investment in a Plexiglass barrier would have prevented a patient from stabbing a Perth/Smiths Falls hospital admitting clerk in the neck. Better alarms would have enabled nurses at Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s St. Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Health Centre to summon help when a patient, asked to take his medication, became violent.</description>

      <description>St. Joseph’s Health Centre is in the process of making a decision about how to prepare and deliver food in its cafeteria.
Rather than serve “TV dinner” style food from a factory operation outside of Toronto, we think the hospital should consider patient well-being and the needs of the community.
We are calling on St. Joseph’s to:  Serve food that is cooked in-house Use good quality, fresh ingredients Use locally sourced, organic food when possible Focus on patient well-being, not cutting corners  There is a local food solution Parkdale is already home to a local food movement.</description>

      <description>Often during an union organizing drive workers and the employer will focus primarily on monetary issues.
Employers will often scare workers into believing that they will take home less as a result of paying union dues.
The fact is that unionized workers earn more than non union workers. That is one of the reasons why employers don&amp;rsquo;t want a union in the workplace. The other reason they don&amp;rsquo;t want a union is because they lose the absolute control they currently have.</description>

KINGSTON, ON — Below average provincial funding of about 1.4 per cent for the newly amalgamated Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC) in 2017, “is bad news for patient care and cause for alarm at a time of significant change,” said Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) 1974 president Mike Rodrigues at a media conference today.
A general 3.1 per cent increase in hospital funding was proposed in the 2017 provincial budget last April.</description>

      <description>The problem of violence against care staff Ontario healthcare workers are subject to a higher rate of workplace violence than policing or corrections.
Some of the violence is so severe that the staff member who is assaulted will never work again.
CUPE conducted focus groups on violence at hospitals and long term care facilities across Ontario in 2016 and 2017, in conjunction with the University of Stirling. The findings will be published in an international journal of occupational health and safety this fall.</description>

      <description>Nursing Graduate Guarantee Programme Changes Changes made to the Nursing Graduate Guarantee Programme in April concern CUPE because it more strongly encourages the hiring into full-time positions of nurses who have just graduated from community college.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A percentage of not less than 40% of the employees must sign union membership cards, then an application for certification is submitted to the Ontario Labour Relations Board.  One week later the Ontario Labour Relations Board holds a secret ballot vote at your workplace.  In order for the union to be successful fifty percent plus one of the employees who cast a ballot must vote in favour of the union.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Management&amp;rsquo;s message A good employer will respect your right to make an informed decision about whether joining CUPE is the right choice for you and your colleagues. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for employers to be afraid that you will join the Union so they resort to using union busting companies or the tactics promoted by those companies. These tactics typically take one of two directions. Either they take the &amp;lsquo;sweet talking&amp;rsquo; direction or they choose to &amp;lsquo;exploit fear of the unknown&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The Ontario Labour Relations Act (OLRA) In Ontario the OLRA protects the rights of workers to join a Union. Sections 70 and 72 of the OLRA prohibit employers from interfering with an employee’s right to join a union and ensures that employees are free from coercion, intimidation, threats, promises or undue influence, including reprisals for their support and involvement with the union.

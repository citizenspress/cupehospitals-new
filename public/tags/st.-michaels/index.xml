      <description>What should I do if I hold a position at more than one location? Nothing! The employer has advised CUPE that they will not be making any changes at this time, even if you are working more than the Full time Equivalent or max hours in the collective agreement.
Human Resources as advised all their managers of this so no one should be advised by their manager or supervisor that they need to resign from any position.</description>

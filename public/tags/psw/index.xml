      <description>The problem of violence against care staff Ontario healthcare workers are subject to a higher rate of workplace violence than policing or corrections.
Some of the violence is so severe that the staff member who is assaulted will never work again.
CUPE conducted focus groups on violence at hospitals and long term care facilities across Ontario in 2016 and 2017, in conjunction with the University of Stirling. The findings will be published in an international journal of occupational health and safety this fall.</description>

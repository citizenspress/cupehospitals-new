      <description>Hospital workers from Kingston and other southeastern Ontario communities will be demonstrating along with their counterparts at hospitals across the province Wednesday, April 18 at noon.
The rallies are the second in a series of escalating actions that 75,000 hospital workers, who are without a contract, are taking part in this April. It is rare for hospital workers to “visibly” protest in this way around their own contract negotiations.
CUPE, SEIU Healthcare and Unifor have formed an alliance and are mobilizing together to push Ontario hospitals to treat the hospital workers they represent with respect at the bargaining table.</description>

      <description>MEDIA RELEASE, August 2, 2017
KINGSTON, ON — Below average provincial funding of about 1.4 per cent for the newly amalgamated Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC) in 2017, “is bad news for patient care and cause for alarm at a time of significant change,” said Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) 1974 president Mike Rodrigues at a media conference today.
A general 3.1 per cent increase in hospital funding was proposed in the 2017 provincial budget last April.</description>

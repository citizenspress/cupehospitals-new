      <description>Dear CUPE supporter, We’ve heard from many of you about the misinformation and confusion spread by HR in a series of “info sessions” held last week. We would like to restore some facts into the discussion:
 CUPE absolutely can and will protect against layoffs. Our hospital collective agreements have the strongest job security provisions in the industry. CUPE members are entitled to: 5 months notice in advance of layoffs, retraining for other positions within the hospital, bumping rights, recall rights from a layoff to an available opening and layoff benefits and separation allowances.</description>

      <title>Joining a Union</title>

      <description>Often during an union organizing drive workers and the employer will focus primarily on monetary issues.
Employers will often scare workers into believing that they will take home less as a result of paying union dues.
The fact is that unionized workers earn more than non union workers. That is one of the reasons why employers don&amp;rsquo;t want a union in the workplace. The other reason they don&amp;rsquo;t want a union is because they lose the absolute control they currently have.</description>

      <title>To all non-union employees of UHN</title>

      <description>Recently you received a letter from UHN in response to CUPE’s organizing drive. The letter you received contained some inaccuracies and outdated information. In this letter, you will find updated and accurate information regarding CUPE and unions in general.
The first issue that needs to be addressed is regarding the Ontario Liberal Government’s net zero bargaining policy. The government officially ended their net zero policy in the fall of 2016 after it began to fall apart thanks to union contract settlements.</description>

      <title>What to expect from your Employer</title>

      <description>Management&amp;rsquo;s message A good employer will respect your right to make an informed decision about whether joining CUPE is the right choice for you and your colleagues. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for employers to be afraid that you will join the Union so they resort to using union busting companies or the tactics promoted by those companies. These tactics typically take one of two directions. Either they take the &amp;lsquo;sweet talking&amp;rsquo; direction or they choose to &amp;lsquo;exploit fear of the unknown&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The Ontario Labour Relations Act (OLRA) In Ontario the OLRA protects the rights of workers to join a Union. Sections 70 and 72 of the OLRA prohibit employers from interfering with an employee’s right to join a union and ensures that employees are free from coercion, intimidation, threats, promises or undue influence, including reprisals for their support and involvement with the union. If the employer violates those rights CUPE will file an Unfair Labour Practice application with the Labour Board.</description>

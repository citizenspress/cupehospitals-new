# Joining CUPE

A process is underway to determine the appropriate bargaining units and respective unions that will represent workers in the newly merged “Our Shared Purpose” hospital network. 

Before a vote is called, the Labour Board, the employer and the unions must first determine the following: number and structure of bargaining units in the merged hospital; what positions will be included; and which unions will be on each ballot. The next mediation date is scheduled for June 2018. This means that a vote will not likely take place until Fall 2018.

CUPE is committed to representing you as a card signer. All supporters who provide their contact information by signing a CUPE membership card will ensure that CUPE will be your union of choice. CUPE will continue to keep you up to date and remain active and engaged at your worksite.

Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions.

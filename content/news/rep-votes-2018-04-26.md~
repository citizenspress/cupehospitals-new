As you are aware, a process is underway to determine the appropriate bargaining units and respective unions that will represent workers in the newly merged "Our Shared Purpose" hospital network. Before a vote is called, the Labour Board, the employer and the unions must first determine the following: number and structure of bargaining units in the merged hospital; what positions will be included; and which unions will be on each ballot. The next mediation date is scheduled for June 2018. This means that a vote will not likely take place until Fall 2018.
